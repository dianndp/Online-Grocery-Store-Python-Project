# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis
Analyzed by: Diana Postica
##

## Project Deliverables
+ Jupyter Notebooks with a step-by-step analysis of data.
+ The final project that well documents every step of the analysis and presents insights together with visualizations and business recommendations. 

## Analysis Objective
Perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of Insacart's data in order
to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on
the provided criteria.

## Key Questions
* The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
times when there are fewer orders.
* They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
these times.
* Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
* Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
product orders.
* The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.
